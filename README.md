# Amperage and Pressure Calculator
 Calculator created by me with the purpose of practicing my web development skills and assisting in my daily work routine.

 ## Objective and Purpose
 Facilitate the calculation process of both amperage and pressure, which I perform every hour for the air conditioners that I inspect and review for quality.

 ## Explaining How the Calculation Is Done
 - First, every hour I calculate the values for the first devices that come to me.
 - I separate both the amperage and pressure values.
 - I exclude the highest and lowest values.
 - I sum the remaining five values and then divide by five, obtaining the average.
 - I add and subtract 5% to the amperage calculation, and for the pressure calculation, the value is adjusted by 15%.
 - This gives me both the maximum and minimum values that the amperage and pressure can reach.
 - Finally, I add and subtract 0.10 units from the maximum and minimum values to determine the tolerance for amperage and pressure, completing the process.

 ## How to Use the Calculator
 It's very simple: just fill in the fields with the values you want to calculate, and the calculator will do all the math and return the results in a table below.
